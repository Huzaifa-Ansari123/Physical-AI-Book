# Real-Time Control

Implementing low-latency robot control systems.

## Overview

Real-time control is critical for responsive and safe robot operation.

## Control Architectures

- **Centralized**: Single controller
- **Distributed**: Multiple controllers
- **Hierarchical**: Layered control

## Real-Time Considerations

- Deterministic execution
- Latency budgets
- Jitter minimization
- Priority scheduling

## Coming Soon
