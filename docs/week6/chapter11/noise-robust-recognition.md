# Noise-Robust Recognition

Maintaining ASR accuracy in challenging acoustic environments.

## Overview

Robots operate in noisy environments, requiring robust speech recognition.

## Noise Types

- **Stationary**: HVAC, machinery hum
- **Non-stationary**: Footsteps, doors
- **Speech**: Other speakers, TV
- **Reverberant**: Room acoustics

## Robustness Techniques

- Noise suppression
- Beamforming
- Multi-condition training
- Domain adaptation

## Coming Soon

This content is under development.
