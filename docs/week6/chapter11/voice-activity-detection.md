# Voice Activity Detection

Detecting when speech is present in audio streams.

## Overview

VAD identifies speech segments in continuous audio, crucial for efficient ASR.

## Detection Methods

- **Energy-based**: Signal power thresholding
- **Statistical**: GMM, HMM approaches
- **Neural**: CNN, RNN classifiers
- **Hybrid**: Combining multiple methods

## Challenges

- Background noise
- Non-speech sounds
- Multiple speakers
- Real-time constraints

## Coming Soon

This content is under development.
