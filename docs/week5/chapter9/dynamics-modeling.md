# Dynamics Modeling

Understanding forces and motion in humanoid robots.

## Overview

Dynamics modeling relates forces and torques to robot motion.

## Key Concepts

- **Newton-Euler Equations**: Force-based formulation
- **Lagrangian Mechanics**: Energy-based formulation
- **Rigid Body Dynamics**: Multi-body systems
- **Contact Dynamics**: Ground reaction forces

## Applications

- Torque computation
- Motion planning
- Control design
- Simulation

## Coming Soon

This content is under development.
