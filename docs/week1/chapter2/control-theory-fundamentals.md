# Control Theory Fundamentals

Understanding control systems for robotics applications.

## Overview

Control theory provides the mathematical foundation for designing systems that behave in desired ways.

## Key Concepts

- **Feedback Control**: Using output measurements to adjust inputs
- **PID Controllers**: Proportional-Integral-Derivative control
- **State Space**: Mathematical representation of physical systems
- **Stability**: Ensuring systems remain bounded
