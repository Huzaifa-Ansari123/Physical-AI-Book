# Sensors and Actuators

Simulating robot perception and movement.

## Overview

Accurate sensor and actuator simulation is crucial for sim-to-real transfer.

## Common Sensors

- **Camera**: RGB, depth, stereo
- **LiDAR**: 2D and 3D laser scanners
- **IMU**: Inertial measurement unit
- **Contact Sensors**: Force/torque

## Actuators

- **Motors**: Position, velocity, effort control
- **Grippers**: Parallel jaw, suction
- **Joints**: Revolute, prismatic, continuous
