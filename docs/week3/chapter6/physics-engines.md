# Physics Engines

Understanding simulation physics for robotics.

## Overview

Physics engines determine how objects interact in simulation, affecting realism and performance.

## Available Engines

- **ODE**: Open Dynamics Engine (default)
- **Bullet**: Game and robotics physics
- **DART**: Dynamic Animation and Robotics Toolkit
- **Simbody**: Biomechanics focused

## Considerations

- **Accuracy vs Speed**: Trade-offs
- **Contact Models**: Friction, compliance
- **Timestep**: Simulation stability
- **Parallelization**: GPU acceleration

## Coming Soon

This content is under development.
