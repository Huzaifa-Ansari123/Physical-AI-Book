# TODO: Enhance Homepage for "The Book Physical AI Learning"

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Update `Teaching-Physical-AI/src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx`: Replace generic features with book-specific topics (e.g., Introduction to Physical AI, ROS 2 Fundamentals, etc.) and engaging descriptions.
- [ ] Edit `Teaching-Physical-AI/src/pages/index.module.css`: Add custom styles for new sections (gradients, spacing, animations) to make the page attractive and engaging.
- [x] Edit `Teaching-Physical-AI/src/pages/index.tsx`: Expand HomepageHeader with additional engaging sections (introduction paragraph, "Why Read This Book?", key insights, more CTAs) and integrate HomepageFeatures component.
- [ ] Test the updated homepage by running the development server and verifying responsiveness and engagement elements.
